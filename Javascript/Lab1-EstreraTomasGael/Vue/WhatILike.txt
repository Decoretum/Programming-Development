What do I like about Vue.js framework?

- I like this framework's ability to reuse components repeatedly!
- Components can reuse other components for front-end formatting, hence these components
could then serve as templates to one another, making front-end designing and coding pontentially cleaner!
- Data-binding in Vue.js is something i also like because I like how i return component data within the component
which is then returned to the document itself! It's similar to Django's front-end views but with no
manipulation or access to queried objects in the database.
