This is the 2nd framework that I used to create the form after Vue. 

What I like about Svelte is its simple syntax and simple interface which allows me to somehow
find it familiar to Vue's single page application system wherein you simply need to export the component 
and add it as an HTML element.

Svelte's data binding is also somewhat similar to Vue wherein they're reactive to each other since changing
the input value would also change the JS variable.
