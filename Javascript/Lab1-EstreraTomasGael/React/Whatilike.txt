What I like about React is how it incorporates some Object-Oriented concepts and
rules for setting up components, integrating components, and binding data together.

In order to create a solid component for an App, I needed to create a Class that would contain
constructors, states (data binding), methods, and event handlers, as well as conditional 
rendering through functions. I liked all of these! It reminds me of Django, but as a front-end version 
of it. This is coming from someone who hates CSS. I find React to be similar to Vue in such a way
that they reuse components.
