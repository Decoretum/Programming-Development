# Programming-Development
This repository contains files from University activities/projects, Leetcode, and personal projects. <br><br>
A separate repository will be created for my Business Applications Development, a trilogy of courses that aims to deliver a working and functional application suited for a direct business need with a real-life client. <br><br>
My Capstone project, which is the culminating project for my MIS curriculum which intends to develop and/or deliver an IT application will also have a separate repository as well. <br><br>

# Samples of successful projects/activities include (but not limited to):
      - Philippine Election System (Web application, University)
      - Inventory Order System (Web application, Personal Project) 
      - POS System (Standalone application, University) 
      - Note-taking System including editing, deletion, modification, and addition of entries using MySQL (Standalone Application, Personal Project)
      - Data Structures and Algorithms written in python and Java (University and personal) 

 There are still lots of programming assessments/activities from University that I've done that aren't featured in this repository such as Web Frameworks (ISCS 30.37) and much more. <br>
 
 Leetcode is done through Java with no Red Hat support as well as Java debugging extensions.
