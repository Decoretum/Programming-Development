Creational - Ways to create objects
Structural - Ways these objects are related
Behavioral - Interaction/communication between these objects

Coupling - how much objects are dependent or coupled to each other
- if you change an aspect or characteristic of an object (which is where other objects are depended on), this could create cascading effects on the 
other dependent classes
- application should be loosely coupled using interfaces

interfaces
- a contract that specifices capabilities that a class should provide

Encapsulation
- bundling data (access modifiers), setting methods for those data (getter, setter)
- for robust applications
