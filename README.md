# Programming-Development
This repository contains files from University activities/projects, and personal projects. <br><br>
A separate repository will be created for my Business Applications Development, a trilogy of courses that aims to deliver a working and functional application suited for a direct business need. <br><br>

<h1> Samples of successful projects/activities include (but not limited to): </h1> <br><br>
      1. Philippine Election System (Web application, University)
      2. Inventory Order System (Web application, Personal Project) 
      3. POS System (Standalone application, University) 
      4. Note-taking System including editing, deletion, modification, and addition of entries using MySQL (Standalone Application, Personal Project)
      5. Data Structures and Algorithms written in python and Java (University and personal) <br><br> 

    * There are still lots of programming assessments/activities from University that I've done that aren't featured in this repository.
