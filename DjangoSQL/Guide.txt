export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/mysql/bin

export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/mysql/lib

We changed timezone to "Hongkong"
We edited allowed hosts to be "127.0.0.1" and "localhost"
Changed database to MySQL

For Project settings.py, we included
"appname" in installed apps

For project urls.py, we included
path('',include('app.urls'))

if I had errors on database, comment out everything involving database
and migrate with python3 manage.py migrate --FAKE
